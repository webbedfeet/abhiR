#' Reloading utility functions into R
#'
#' This function creates a new environment in R, sources all the R script files
#' in a directory into that environment, and attaches that environment to the
#' current namespace. This is a "poor man" packaging system before a formal package is written
#'
#' This function is meant to load utility functions into R without cluttering the
#' namespace. It is a "poor man's" packaging withouth formal packaging
#' @param d The directory where the utility functions reside. Defaults to the "lib"
#'   sub-directory of the current directory
#' @return Invisibly attaches an environment to the current workspace, named "fn"
